This repo is supposed to contain tests embodying the correct behavior of the SecureCells instructions.

### Description

TODO: Describe how bootstrap works
TODO: Describe how tests (particularly exceptions) work.

### How to run

Compile with `make`.

On one terminal, run qemu:

`qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt_sc -bios <path to fw_dynamic.elf> -kernel ./fpga_test -nographic -s -S`

QEMU should be able to run these tests with either machine `virt` or machine `virt_sc`. For `virt`, the OpenSBI firmware should emulate the dynamic SC instructions.

On the other terminal, debug with gdb:

`riscv64-unknown-elf-gdb -x gdb_script`

The script is set up to output `correct` or `wrong` based on whether all tests ran successfully or not. The script also catches unexpected exceptions `bad exception`.

### Modifying tests

Be careful about modifying tests, since the code runs partially in physical addressing modes, and partially in virtual addressing. Therefore, care has to be taken to keep the code position-independent. Everything except `init.c` and `bootstrap.S` should exclusively use virtual addresses and have `static` global variables only. This ensures that there is no PLT, and all addresses are pc-relative.
